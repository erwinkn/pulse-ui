- Mantine styles should work without a FOUC with just the Pulse-level imports, without forcing them into app.css. There is still a FOUC in the Mantine examples, even with this change, so this doesn't address the core issue
- Session context is now reactive, msal_auth.py example works perfectly.
- Does disabling the Vite HMR means that we don't get hot reloading for local React components that may be used in the Pulse app? If so, we should find a way to have HMR both in the JS code while keeping our setup working
- Doing `PULSE_SERVER_ADDRESS=http://localhost:8099 pulse build examples/main.py` and `PULSE_SERVER_ADDRESS=http://localhost:8099 pulse start examples/main.py --port 8099` builds and starts the app correctly. I'm using port 8099 to avoid conflicts with other servers running on the same machine. However, the CSS doesn't load, interactivity doesn't work and I'm seeing this error in the logs: "[server] INFO:     127.0.0.1:52656 - "GET /src/entry-client.tsx HTTP/1.1" 404 Not Found". You can test it yourself using the same commands and using agent-browser to open the app
