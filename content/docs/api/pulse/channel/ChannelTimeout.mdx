title: ChannelTimeout

Raised when a channel request times out waiting for a response.

This exception is raised by ``Channel.request()`` when the specified
timeout elapses before receiving a response from the client.

Example:

```python
result = await ch.request("get_value", timeout=5.0)  # Raises if no response in 5s
```
