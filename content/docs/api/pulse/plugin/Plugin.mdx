title: Plugin
---

Base class for application plugins.

Plugins extend application functionality by contributing routes,
middleware, and lifecycle hooks. Create a subclass and override
the methods you need.

## Attributes

<PyAttribute name={"priority"} type={"int"} value={"0"}>

Plugin execution order. Higher values run first.
Defaults to 0. Use positive values for plugins that should
initialize early (e.g., auth), negative for late initialization.

</PyAttribute>

## Functions

<PyFunction name={"routes"} type={"(self) -> list[Route | Layout]"}>

Return routes to add to the application.

Override to contribute routes from this plugin. Routes are added
after user-defined routes in the App constructor.

<PySourceCode >

```python
def routes(self) -> list[Route | Layout]:
	"""Return routes to add to the application.

	Override to contribute routes from this plugin. Routes are added
	after user-defined routes in the App constructor.

	Returns:
		List of Route or Layout objects to register.
	"""
	return []
```

</PySourceCode>

<div >

<PyParameter name={"self"} type={null} value={null} />

</div>

<PyFunctionReturn type={"list"}>

List of Route or Layout objects to register.

</PyFunctionReturn>

</PyFunction>

<PyFunction name={"middleware"} type={"(self) -> list[PulseMiddleware]"}>

Return middleware to add to the application.

Override to contribute middleware from this plugin. Middleware
is added after user-defined middleware.

<PySourceCode >

```python
def middleware(self) -> list[PulseMiddleware]:
	"""Return middleware to add to the application.

	Override to contribute middleware from this plugin. Middleware
	is added after user-defined middleware.

	Returns:
		List of PulseMiddleware instances to register.
	"""
	return []
```

</PySourceCode>

<div >

<PyParameter name={"self"} type={null} value={null} />

</div>

<PyFunctionReturn type={"list"}>

List of PulseMiddleware instances to register.

</PyFunctionReturn>

</PyFunction>

<PyFunction name={"on_setup"} type={"(self, app) -> None"}>

Called after FastAPI routes are configured.

Override to perform setup that requires FastAPI routes to exist,
such as adding custom endpoints or middleware.

<PySourceCode >

```python
def on_setup(self, app: App) -> None:
	"""Called after FastAPI routes are configured.

	Override to perform setup that requires FastAPI routes to exist,
	such as adding custom endpoints or middleware.

	Args:
		app: The Pulse application instance.
	"""
	...
```

</PySourceCode>

<div >

<PyParameter name={"self"} type={null} value={null} />
<PyParameter name={"app"} type={"App"} value={undefined}>

The Pulse application instance.

</PyParameter>

</div>

<PyFunctionReturn type={"None"} />

</PyFunction>

<PyFunction name={"on_startup"} type={"(self, app) -> None"}>

Called when the application starts.

Override to perform initialization when the server begins
accepting connections, such as connecting to databases or
initializing caches.

<PySourceCode >

```python
def on_startup(self, app: App) -> None:
	"""Called when the application starts.

	Override to perform initialization when the server begins
	accepting connections, such as connecting to databases or
	initializing caches.

	Args:
		app: The Pulse application instance.
	"""
	...
```

</PySourceCode>

<div >

<PyParameter name={"self"} type={null} value={null} />
<PyParameter name={"app"} type={"App"} value={undefined}>

The Pulse application instance.

</PyParameter>

</div>

<PyFunctionReturn type={"None"} />

</PyFunction>

<PyFunction name={"on_shutdown"} type={"(self, app) -> None"}>

Called when the application shuts down.

Override to perform cleanup when the server is stopping,
such as closing database connections or flushing caches.

<PySourceCode >

```python
def on_shutdown(self, app: App) -> None:
	"""Called when the application shuts down.

	Override to perform cleanup when the server is stopping,
	such as closing database connections or flushing caches.

	Args:
		app: The Pulse application instance.
	"""
	...
```

</PySourceCode>

<div >

<PyParameter name={"self"} type={null} value={null} />
<PyParameter name={"app"} type={"App"} value={undefined}>

The Pulse application instance.

</PyParameter>

</div>

<PyFunctionReturn type={"None"} />

</PyFunction>
