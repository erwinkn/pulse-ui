title: StateProperty
---

Descriptor for reactive properties on State classes.

StateProperty wraps a Signal and provides automatic reactivity for
class attributes. When a property is read, it subscribes to the underlying
Signal. When written, it updates the Signal and triggers re-renders.

This class is typically not used directly. Instead, declare typed attributes
on a State subclass, and the StateMeta metaclass will automatically convert
them into StateProperty instances.

Example:

```python
class MyState(ps.State):
    count: int = 0  # Automatically becomes a StateProperty
    name: str = "default"

state = MyState()
state.count = 5  # Updates the underlying Signal
print(state.count)  # Reads from the Signal, subscribes to changes
```
