# Documentation Next Steps

## 1. Review recent changes
- Skim through updated pages to ensure tone is consistent
- Verify code examples still make sense with added context
- Check that links between pages work

## 2. Fill content gaps
- Tutorial pages (01-15) are good, but some guide pages reference features without full examples
- Reference pages beyond `pulse/index.mdx` are likely still terse (pulse-js, pulse-transpiler)

## 3. Add a "Common Patterns" or "Recipes" section
- The cookbook exists but could be promoted more prominently
- Real-world examples help beginners more than abstract explanations

## 4. Improve discoverability
- Check `meta.json` files to ensure navigation order makes sense
- Consider adding "What to read next" at the bottom of more pages

## 5. Test the setup flow
- Run through `setup.mdx` on a fresh machine to catch missing steps
- The React Router scaffolding command may have changed

## 6. Get feedback
- Have someone unfamiliar with Pulse read Getting Started and first few tutorial pages
- Note where they get confused
