Cursor is an AI-powered IDE based on VS Code. It provides inline completions, chat, and multi-file editing with composer mode.

## Setup

1. Download [Cursor](https://cursor.sh) and open your Pulse project

2. Create a `.cursorrules` file at your repository root:

```text
You are working on a Pulse application.

Pulse is a full-stack Python framework for interactive web apps.
It uses React with WebSocket-driven UI updates.

## Commands
- uv run pulse run app.py - Start dev server on :8000
- make all - Format, lint, typecheck, test (run before committing)
- uv sync - Install Python dependencies
- bun i - Install JS dependencies (in web/ folder)

## Key Patterns

State classes inherit from ps.State:
```python
class MyState(ps.State):
    value: str = ""

    def update(self, new_value: str):
        self.value = new_value
```

Components use @ps.component decorator:
```python
@ps.component
def MyComponent():
    with ps.init():
        state = MyState()
    return ps.div(ps.p(state.value))
```

Use ps.init() to preserve state across renders.
Use @ps.query for async data fetching.
Use @ps.computed for cached derived values.

## Style
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling via className prop
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Be concise, minimize state and helpers
```

## Features

### Inline Completions

Cursor provides completions as you type. For best results with Pulse:

- Start typing `class` to get state class suggestions
- Type `@ps.` to see available decorators
- Begin event handlers with `def on_` for completion

### Chat (Cmd+L)

Ask questions about your code or request changes:

```text
How do I add a loading state to this query?
```

```text
Create a modal component with open/close state
```

### Composer (Cmd+I)

For multi-file changes, use composer mode:

```text
Add user authentication to the app:
1. Create AuthState with user info and login/logout methods
2. Add a login page component
3. Protect the dashboard route with auth check
4. Show user name in the header
```

## Workflows

### Creating Components

1. Open chat (Cmd+L)
2. Describe the component:
```text
Create a Pulse component for a data table with:
- Sortable columns
- Pagination
- Row selection
Use DataTableState for the logic.
```

### Understanding Code

Select code and press Cmd+L:
```text
Explain how this query's dependencies are tracked
```

### Refactoring

Use composer for larger changes:
```text
Refactor the dashboard to use separate state classes for:
- User data (UserState)
- Notifications (NotificationState)
- Settings (SettingsState)
Keep them coordinated through the main DashboardState.
```

## Tips

- **Include context**: Reference files with `@filename` in chat
- **Iterate**: Ask follow-up questions to refine generated code
- **Verify**: Run `make all` in the terminal after AI edits
- **Examples**: Point Cursor to `examples/` folder for patterns
