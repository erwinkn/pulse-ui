Ready-to-use prompts for working with Pulse. Copy these into any AI tool to provide context about the framework.

## Quick Context Prompts

### Minimal (for chat-based tools)

```text
Pulse app. Python + React via WebSockets. Use ps.State for state,
@ps.component for components, ps.init() to preserve state.
Commands: uv run pulse run app.py, make all.
```

### Standard (for agentic tools)

```text
I'm building a Pulse application.

Pulse is a full-stack Python framework for interactive web apps.
The Python code renders to React components via WebSocket.

Key patterns:
- State: class MyState(ps.State) with typed properties and methods
- Components: @ps.component decorator on render functions
- Hooks: ps.init() preserves variables, ps.setup() runs once
- Async: @ps.query for data fetching, @ps.effect for side effects

Commands:
- uv run pulse run app.py (dev server)
- make all (validate before commit)
```

## Task-Specific Prompts

### Creating a Component

```text
Create a Pulse component for [describe UI].

Requirements:
- Use a [Name]State class for state management
- Include event handlers as state methods
- Style with Tailwind CSS (className prop)
- Follow this structure:

class ComponentState(ps.State):
    # typed properties with defaults
    # methods for state updates

@ps.component
def Component():
    with ps.init():
        state = ComponentState()
    return ps.div(...)
```

### Adding a Query

```text
Add data fetching to this component using @ps.query.

The query should:
- Fetch [describe data] from [endpoint/source]
- Show loading state while fetching
- Handle errors gracefully
- Re-fetch when [dependency] changes

Pattern:
class MyState(ps.State):
    @ps.query
    async def data(self) -> ReturnType:
        # async fetch logic
        return result
```

### Debugging State Issues

```text
The component state isn't persisting across renders.

Check:
1. Is the state created inside ps.init()?
2. Are state properties properly typed?
3. Is the component decorated with @ps.component?

Correct pattern:
@ps.component
def MyComponent():
    with ps.init():  # Required!
        state = MyState()
    return ps.div(...)
```

### Refactoring to Computed

```text
Convert this derived value to a @ps.computed property.

Before: calculated inline in render
After: cached computed that updates only when dependencies change

class MyState(ps.State):
    items: list[Item]
    filter: str

    @ps.computed
    def filtered_items(self) -> list[Item]:
        # filter logic here
        return [i for i in self.items if ...]
```

## AGENTS.md Template

Use this as a starting point for your project's AI configuration file:

```markdown
# [Project Name]

[One-line description]

## Commands

```bash
uv run pulse run app.py   # Dev server on :8000
make all                   # Format, lint, typecheck, test
uv sync                    # Install Python deps
bun i                      # Install JS deps (in web/)
```

## Structure

- `app.py` - Main application entry
- `components/` - Reusable components
- `states/` - State class definitions
- `web/` - Generated React frontend

## Pulse Patterns

### State
```python
class ExampleState(ps.State):
    value: str = ""
    items: list[str] = []

    def update(self, v: str):
        self.value = v

    @ps.computed
    def count(self) -> int:
        return len(self.items)

    @ps.query
    async def data(self) -> dict:
        return await fetch_data()
```

### Component
```python
@ps.component
def Example():
    with ps.init():
        state = ExampleState()

    return ps.div(
        ps.p(state.value),
        ps.button("Update", onClick=lambda: state.update("new"))
    )
```

## Rules

- Always use ps.init() for state in components
- Run make all before committing
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Prefer state methods over inline lambdas for complex logic
```

## Conversation Starters

### New Project

```text
Help me build a [type] app with Pulse. Features needed:
- [Feature 1]
- [Feature 2]
- [Feature 3]

Start with the main state class and core components.
```

### Existing Project

```text
I have a Pulse app with [describe current state].
I want to add [feature].

Current structure:
- [List main files/components]

What's the best approach?
```

### Learning

```text
Explain how [Pulse concept] works. Show me:
1. A minimal example
2. Common use cases
3. Potential pitfalls
```
