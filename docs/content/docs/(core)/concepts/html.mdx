Pulse elements are Python functions that describe what should appear on the page. They're the building blocks of your UI - every button, heading, and container is a Pulse element.

## HTML elements

All standard HTML elements are available as functions on the `ps` module:

```python
ps.div(
    ps.h1("Welcome!"),
    ps.p("This is a paragraph."),
    ps.button("Click me"),
)
```

This produces the HTML you'd expect:

```html
<div>
  <h1>Welcome!</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  <button>Click me</button>
</div>
```

## Props and children

Elements accept two kinds of arguments:

- **Props** (keyword arguments) - attributes like `className`, `id`, or event handlers
- **Children** (positional arguments) - content nested inside the element

```python
ps.button(
    "Click me",              # child (the button text)
    className="btn-primary", # prop
    onClick=handle_click,    # prop (event handler)
)
```

### React naming conventions

Pulse uses React's naming conventions for props:

- `className` instead of `class` (since `class` is a Python keyword)
- `htmlFor` instead of `for` (on label elements)
- `onClick`, `onChange`, etc. for event handlers (camelCase)

### Two ways to pass children

You can pass children as positional arguments:

```python
ps.div(ps.h1("Title"), ps.p("Body"))
```

Or use bracket syntax, which is often cleaner for elements with many children or lots of props:

```python
ps.div(className="container mx-auto p-6")[
    ps.h1("Title", className="text-2xl font-bold"),
    ps.p("Body", className="text-gray-600"),
    ps.button("Action", onClick=do_something),
]
```

The bracket syntax keeps the props visually close to the element name, making the code easier to scan. Use whichever style feels more readable for your situation.

## Nesting elements

Elements can be nested as deeply as you need:

```python
ps.main(className="min-h-screen")[
    ps.header(className="bg-blue-600 text-white p-4")[
        ps.h1("My App"),
    ],
    ps.div(className="container mx-auto p-6")[
        ps.section()[
            ps.h2("Section 1"),
            ps.p("Content goes here..."),
        ],
    ],
]
```
