This section covers the core concepts you need to build Pulse applications. Each page focuses on a specific topic with clear explanations and practical examples.

## Where to start

If you're new to Pulse, we recommend reading these pages in order:

1. **[Mental Model](/docs/concepts/mental-model)** - Understand how Pulse works under the hood
2. **[VDOM and Elements](/docs/concepts/vdom-elements)** - Learn the syntax for building UI
3. **[Components](/docs/concepts/components)** - Create reusable pieces of your application
4. **[State](/docs/concepts/state)** - Make your UI interactive with reactive state

After these fundamentals, explore the other pages based on what you need for your application. Once comfortable with the basics, check out the [Advanced](/docs/advanced) section for topics like channels, JS interop, and custom hooks.

## Concepts vs Tutorial

The **[Tutorial](/docs/tutorial)** walks you through building a complete application step by step. It's great for learning by doing.

**Core Concepts** is reference-oriented. Each page explains one concept thoroughly, with code examples you can adapt to your own projects. Come here when you need to understand how something works or refresh your memory on the details.
