title: "Debounce event handlers"
---

Reduce noisy UI events so the server only sees the last call after a pause.

## Basic usage

```python
import pulse as ps


class SearchState(ps.State):
	query: str
	calls: int

	def __init__(self):
		self.query = ""
		self.calls = 0

	def update(self, event):
		self.calls += 1
		self.query = event["target"]["value"]


@ps.component
def SearchBox():
	with ps.init():
		state = SearchState()

	return ps.div(
		ps.input(
			placeholder="Search...",
			onChange=ps.debounced(state.update, 300),
		),
		ps.p(f"Calls: {state.calls}"),
	)
```

Type quickly in the input. The counter only bumps after you pause for 300ms.

## How it works

- `ps.debounced(fn, delay_ms)` wraps a server callback, but the debounce happens in the browser.
- The event payload is snapshotted at call time, so `event["target"]["value"]` is safe even after the delay.
- If the debounce delay changes, any pending call still fires, and the new delay applies to later calls.
