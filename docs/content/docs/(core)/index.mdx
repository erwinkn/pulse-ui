Welcome to Pulse! If you've ever wished you could build interactive web apps without leaving Python, you're in the right place.

## What is Pulse?

Pulse is a full-stack Python framework for building reactive web applications. You write your entire app in Python—components, state, events, everything—and Pulse handles the frontend automatically. No JavaScript required.

Under the hood, Pulse renders a virtual DOM on the server and syncs it to a React client over WebSocket. But you don't need to think about that. Just write Python.

## Who is Pulse for?

- **Python developers** who want to build web UIs without learning JavaScript
- **Data scientists** who need dashboards and internal tools
- **Backend engineers** who want full-stack capabilities in a familiar language

## A taste of Pulse

Here's a complete Pulse app in a few lines:

```python
import pulse as ps

@ps.component
def home():
    return ps.div("Hello Pulse")

app = ps.App([ps.Route("/", home)])
```

That's it—a working web app with routing, ready to grow into something bigger.

## Ready to get started?

Head to the [Setup Guide](/docs/setup) to install Pulse and run your first app in minutes. Or dive into the [Tutorial](/docs/tutorial) for a hands-on walkthrough of all the fundamentals.
