To use Pulse effectively, it helps to understand what's happening behind the scenes. Pulse is a **server-driven UI** framework - your Python code runs on the server and controls what the user sees in their browser.

## The render cycle

Here's how Pulse works:

1. **Python renders a virtual DOM (VDOM)** - Your component functions return Pulse elements that describe what the UI should look like
2. **The client receives a diff** - Pulse compares the new VDOM to what's currently displayed and sends only the changes to the browser
3. **User events call back to Python** - When someone clicks a button or types in an input, that event is sent to your Python code
4. **State changes trigger a new render** - Your event handler updates the state, which causes Pulse to re-render and repeat the cycle

This cycle is the core loop of every Pulse application:

```
State -> Render -> User interaction -> State update -> Re-render -> ...
```

## Sessions and isolation

Each browser tab gets its own **render session**. This means:

- State is isolated per tab - opening your app in two tabs creates two independent sessions
- Users don't share state with each other (unless you explicitly set up shared state via a database or similar)
- Refreshing the page starts a fresh session

A render session is tied to a specific route. When users navigate between routes, Pulse manages the session lifecycle automatically.

## Why server-driven?

With Pulse, your business logic stays on the server. This means:

- **Security** - Sensitive logic never reaches the client
- **Simplicity** - No need to build and maintain a separate API layer
- **Python everywhere** - Use your favorite Python libraries directly in your UI code

The tradeoff is that every user interaction requires a round-trip to the server. Pulse minimizes the impact through efficient diffing and batched updates, but it's good to keep this in mind for latency-sensitive applications.
