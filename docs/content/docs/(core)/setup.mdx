Welcome to Pulse! This guide will walk you through creating your first Pulse application from scratch.

<Callout type="warn" title="Early access">
Pulse is under active development and this setup process will be simplified in the future. For now, you need two parts: a Python project (your app logic) and a small Vite SSR frontend.
</Callout>

## What you'll need

Before getting started, make sure you have these tools installed:

- **[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)** — A fast Python package manager
- **[Bun](https://bun.sh/)** — A JavaScript runtime and package manager

## Step 1: Create your Python project

First, let's set up a new directory for your Pulse app and initialize it as a Python project:

```bash
mkdir my-pulse-app
cd my-pulse-app
uv init
uv add pulse-framework
uv sync
```

This creates a new Python project managed by uv and installs the Pulse framework.

Now create a file called `app.py` with your first Pulse component:

```python
from pathlib import Path
import pulse as ps

@ps.component
def home():
    return ps.div("Hello Pulse")

app = ps.App(
    routes=[ps.Route("/", home)],
    codegen=ps.CodegenConfig(web_dir=Path(__file__).parent / "web"),
)
```

Let's break down what's happening here:

- **`@ps.component`** — This decorator turns a Python function into a Pulse component. Components are the building blocks of your UI.
- **`ps.div("Hello Pulse")`** — This creates a `<div>` element with the text "Hello Pulse" inside it. Pulse provides functions like `div`, `span`, `button`, etc. that map to HTML elements.
- **`ps.App`** — This is your application object. It holds your routes and configuration.
- **`ps.Route("/", home)`** — This tells Pulse to render the `home` component when someone visits the root URL (`/`).
- **`CodegenConfig(web_dir=...)`** — This tells Pulse where your web frontend lives (we'll create that next).

## Step 2: Create the frontend (Vite SSR)

Pulse expects a Vite SSR app with a few entry points. The easiest path today is to copy the starter from the Pulse repo.

```bash
# From a clone of the Pulse repo
cp -R examples/web ./web
```

You can use `examples/web` as a reference for the required files (`vite.config.ts`, `src/entry-client.tsx`, `src/entry-server.tsx`, `server/ssr.ts`, etc.).

## Step 3: Run your app

Now you're ready to start your Pulse app:

```bash
uv run pulse dev app.py
```

`pulse dev` does two things:
1. **Generates route files** — It writes `web/app/pulse/*` from your Python routes
2. **Starts the dev stack** — Python server + Vite dev server + SSR server

Open the URL shown in your terminal (usually `http://localhost:8000`) and you should see "Hello Pulse" displayed in your browser!

## Customizing the frontend location

By default, Pulse expects your web app to be in a `web/` folder next to your Python file. If your frontend lives somewhere else, just update the `web_dir` setting:

```python
codegen=ps.CodegenConfig(web_dir=Path("/path/to/your/web-app"))
```

## Next steps

Now that you have a working Pulse app, head over to the [Tutorial](/docs/tutorial) to learn how to build interactive UIs with state, events, and more.
