Welcome to the Pulse tutorial! In this guide, we'll walk through the fundamentals of building interactive web applications with Pulse. By the end, you'll understand how to create components, manage state, handle user events, and build reusable UI pieces.

## What is Pulse?

Pulse is a full-stack Python framework for building interactive web apps. You write your UI logic in Python, and Pulse handles the React frontend and WebSocket-driven updates automatically. If you've used frameworks like React or Vue, you'll feel right at home with Pulse's component model. If you're coming from pure Python, you'll appreciate how Pulse lets you build rich web UIs without writing JavaScript.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) for Python package management
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation) for JavaScript tooling

## Getting Started

Create a file (e.g., `app.py`) and run it with:

```bash
uv run pulse dev path/to/app.py
```

Your terminal will show tagged logs for the server, assets, and SSR processes. Visit the URL shown (usually http://localhost:8000) to see your app. Use `q` to stop.

Pulse automatically reloads when you make changes during development, so you can iterate quickly.

## What's Next?

This tutorial is organized into short, focused pages:

1. **Basics** - Create your first component and render HTML
2. **State** - Add interactivity with reactive state
3. **Events** - Respond to user interactions
4. **Components** - Build reusable UI pieces

Each page includes runnable code examples. Feel free to experiment as you go!
