Claude Code is Anthropic's terminal-based AI assistant that can read, write, and execute code in your repository. It excels at multi-file refactoring and understands project context through `CLAUDE.md` files.

## Setup

1. Install Claude Code following [Anthropic's instructions](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)

2. Create a `CLAUDE.md` file at your repository root:

```markdown
# Project Name

Pulse app for [describe your app].

## Commands

- `uv run pulse run app.py` - Start dev server
- `make all` - Format, lint, typecheck, test
- `uv sync` - Install Python deps
- `bun i` - Install JS deps (in web/ folder)

## Structure

- `app.py` - Main application
- `web/` - React frontend (auto-generated)
- `components/` - Reusable Pulse components

## Conventions

- Use `@ps.component` for all components
- Define state as classes inheriting from `ps.State`
- Use `ps.init()` to preserve state across renders
- Use `ps.query` for async data fetching
- Run `make all` before committing
```

## Workflows

### Creating a New Component

```text
Create a Pulse component for a user profile card. It should:
- Display name, email, and avatar
- Have an "Edit" button that toggles edit mode
- Use a ProfileState class with the user data
- Style with Tailwind CSS
```

### Adding State Management

```text
Add state management to the dashboard component:
- Track selected tab (overview, analytics, settings)
- Remember user's filter preferences
- Use a computed for filtered data
```

### Debugging

```text
The counter isn't updating when I click increment.
Check if state is properly initialized with ps.init().
```

### Running Validation

```text
Run make all and fix any errors. Show me the issues found.
```

## Tips

- **Context window**: Claude Code reads `CLAUDE.md` automatically. Put frequently-needed info there.
- **File references**: Use `@filename` to reference specific files in your prompts.
- **Multi-step tasks**: Claude Code handles complex refactoring across multiple files well.
- **Verification**: Always ask it to run `make all` after making changes.

## Example Session

```text
> Create a todo list app with the following features:
  - Add, toggle, and delete todos
  - Filter by all/active/completed
  - Persist to localStorage via a custom hook

> Run the app and verify it works

> Run make all and fix any issues
```
