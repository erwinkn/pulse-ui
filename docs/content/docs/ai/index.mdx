AI coding assistants accelerate Pulse development by generating components, state classes, and event handlers from natural language descriptions. These guides help you configure popular AI tools to work effectively with Pulse's conventions.

## Why AI Tools Work Well with Pulse

Pulse's Python-first approach makes it an excellent fit for AI assistants:

- **Familiar syntax**: Components use standard Python classes and functions
- **Clear patterns**: State management follows consistent conventions (`ps.State`, `@ps.component`, hooks)
- **Type hints**: Comprehensive type annotations help AI understand expected inputs/outputs
- **Self-contained files**: Most Pulse apps fit in single files, providing full context

## Quick Start

For any AI tool, start with this context:

```text
I'm working on a Pulse app. Pulse is a full-stack Python framework for
interactive web apps using React and WebSockets.

Key APIs:
- ps.App, ps.Route: Define app and routes
- ps.State: Reactive state class
- @ps.component: Decorator for components
- ps.init(): Hook to preserve state across renders
- ps.setup(): Run setup function once on first render
- ps.query: Async data fetching with loading states

Run commands: uv (Python), bun (JS), make all (validate)
```

## Repository Configuration

Most AI tools look for instruction files in your repo. Create a `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md` at the root with project-specific rules. See [Prompt Templates](/docs/ai/prompt-templates) for examples.
