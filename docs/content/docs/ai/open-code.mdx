Open Code is an open-source terminal AI coding assistant. It works with various LLM providers and reads project context from markdown files.

## Setup

1. Install Open Code:
```bash
# Using Homebrew
brew install opencode

# Or via npm
npm install -g opencode-ai
```

2. Configure your LLM provider in `~/.opencode/config.yaml`:
```yaml
provider: anthropic  # or openai, ollama, etc.
model: claude-sonnet-4-20250514
```

3. Create an `AGENTS.md` file at your repository root (Open Code reads this automatically):

```markdown
# Pulse App

Python web framework using React + WebSockets.

## Commands

- `uv run pulse run app.py` - Dev server
- `make all` - Validate (format, lint, typecheck, test)
- `uv sync` - Python deps
- `bun i` - JS deps (in web/)

## Core APIs

```python
import pulse as ps

# State
class MyState(ps.State):
    value: int = 0
    def increment(self): self.value += 1

# Component
@ps.component
def Counter():
    with ps.init():
        state = MyState()
    return ps.button(str(state.value), onClick=state.increment)

# App
app = ps.App(routes=[ps.Route("/", Counter)])
```

## Hooks

- `ps.init()` - Preserve variables across renders
- `ps.setup(fn)` - Run once on first render
- `ps.stable(key, value)` - Stable reference to changing value

## Async

- `@ps.query` - Data fetching with loading/error states
- `@ps.effect` - Side effects on state changes
```

## Usage

Start Open Code in your project directory:

```bash
cd your-pulse-app
opencode
```

### Basic Commands

```text
# Create a component
> Create a user profile component with name, email, and edit functionality

# Fix an issue
> The form state resets on every render. Fix the initialization.

# Understand code
> Explain how the TodosState computed property works

# Run validation
> Run make all and show me any errors
```

## Workflows

### New Feature

```text
> Add a notifications system:
  - NotificationState with list of messages
  - Toast component that auto-dismisses
  - Global notification trigger function
```

### Debugging

```text
> The increment button doesn't update the count.
  Check if CounterState is inside ps.init().
```

### Refactoring

```text
> Convert the inline event handlers to state methods for better organization.
```

## Tips

- **Local models**: Open Code works with Ollama for offline development
- **Context**: It reads `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `README.md` for context
- **Streaming**: Responses stream in real-time for faster feedback
- **History**: Use up arrow to recall previous prompts
