description: "How Pulse organizes Python and web output"

Pulse apps are Python-first but generate a React client.

Typical layout:

```text
app/
  main.py
  web/
    app/               # generated by Pulse codegen
    package.json
```

Key paths:
- `app.py` or `main.py`: your `App` instance
- `web/`: client build output and React router
- `app/web/app/pulse/`: generated routes, layout, assets

If you keep your web app elsewhere, set `CodegenConfig(web_dir=...)`.
