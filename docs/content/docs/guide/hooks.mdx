Hooks run once per render.

- `ps.init()` captures locals on first render
- `ps.setup(fn, *args)` runs once, returns cached value
- `ps.state(key, factory)` creates a keyed state instance
- `ps.effects(*fns)` registers effects
- `ps.stable(key, value)` keeps stable refs

All hooks must be called at most once per render.
