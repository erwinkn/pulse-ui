Middleware can intercept prerender, connect, message, and channel flows.

```python
class Auth(ps.PulseMiddleware):
    async def connect(self, *, request, session, next):
        if not session.get("user"):
            return ps.Deny()
        return await next()
```

Use `ps.stack(...)` to compose.
