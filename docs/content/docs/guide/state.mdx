State classes define reactive fields via type annotations.

```python
class Counter(ps.State):
    count: int = 0

    def inc(self):
        self.count += 1
```

Rules:
- Public fields must be annotated
- Private data must be prefixed with `_`

Use `ps.init()` to keep state instances across renders.
