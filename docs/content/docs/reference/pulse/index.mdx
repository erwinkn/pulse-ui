This is the complete API reference for the main `pulse` package. Every export listed here is available directly from the top-level import:

```python
import pulse as ps
```

## App and Routing

These are the building blocks for creating your application and defining its URL structure. Every Pulse app starts with an `App` instance and one or more `Route` definitions.

| Export | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `App` | Main application class |
| `Route` | Route definition |
| `Layout` | Layout wrapper for nested routes |
| `RouteInfo` | TypedDict with current route information |
| `PulseMode` | Literal type: `'single-server'` or `'subdomains'` |
| `CodegenConfig` | Code generation configuration |

## Components

Components are the core abstraction in Pulse. Use the `@component` decorator to create reusable UI pieces, and the helpers below to control rendering flow.

| Export | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `component` | Decorator to define a Pulse component |
| `Component` | Component class (created by decorator) |
| `For` | Map items to elements with automatic key handling |
| `If` | Conditional rendering helper |
| `Link` | Client-side navigation link |
| `Outlet` | Renders child routes in layouts |

## State and Reactivity

Pulse's reactivity system automatically tracks dependencies and updates the UI when data changes. `Signal` holds values, `Computed` derives from them, and `Effect` runs side effects. For complex state, extend the `State` class.

| Export | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `State` | Stateful class base for component state |
| `Signal` | Reactive value container |
| `Computed` | Derived reactive value |
| `Effect` | Side effect that tracks dependencies |
| `AsyncEffect` | Async side effect |
| `Batch` | Context manager to batch reactive updates |
| `Untrack` | Context manager to read without tracking |
| `computed` | Decorator to make a method computed |
| `effect` | Decorator to make a method an effect |
| `ReactiveList` | Reactive list container |
| `ReactiveDict` | Reactive dict container |
| `ReactiveSet` | Reactive set container |

## Hooks

Hooks let you tap into the component lifecycle. Use them inside component functions to run setup code, access state, or manage cleanup.

| Export | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `init` | Run code once when component mounts |
| `setup` | Run setup code with cleanup |
| `setup_key` | Keyed setup for dynamic dependencies |
| `state` | Access component state instance |
| `effects` | Register effects in component |
| `stable` | Get stable reference across renders |

## Runtime Hooks

These hooks access runtime context during rendering: the current route, session data, navigation, and more. Call them inside components to interact with the request lifecycle.

| Export | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `route` | Get current `RouteContext` |
| `session` | Get current session data dict |
| `session_id` | Get current session ID |
| `websocket_id` | Get current WebSocket connection ID |
| `navigate` | Navigate to a URL |
| `redirect` | Redirect and stop rendering |
| `not_found` | Return 404 and stop rendering |
| `call_api` | Call a server API endpoint |
| `set_cookie` | Set a cookie on the client |
| `global_state` | Access global state by type |

## Queries

Queries handle server-side data fetching with automatic caching, refetching, and loading states. Use `query` for reads, `mutation` for writes, and `infinite_query` for paginated data.

| Export | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `query` | Define a data query |
| `mutation` | Define a data mutation |
| `infinite_query` | Define an infinite/paginated query |
| `QueryClient` | Query cache and management |

## Forms

Built-in form handling with typed data extraction. `Form` handles submission automatically; use `ManualForm` when you need custom submit behavior.

| Export | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Form` | Form component with automatic handling |
| `ManualForm` | Form with manual submit control |
| `FormData` | Typed form data container |
| `FormValue` | Single form field value |
| `UploadFile` | Uploaded file (from starlette) |

## Channels

Channels enable real-time bidirectional communication between server and client. Useful for chat, live updates, and streaming data.

| Export | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `channel` | Create a bidirectional channel |
| `Channel` | Channel instance type |
| `ChannelClosed` | Exception for closed channel |
| `ChannelTimeout` | Exception for channel timeout |

## Serialization

Low-level utilities for converting Python objects to JSON-compatible formats for WebSocket transport. Most apps won't need these directly.

| Export | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `serialize` | Serialize Python values for transport |
| `deserialize` | Deserialize transported values |

## JavaScript Interop

Bridge between Python and JavaScript. Use `@javascript` to transpile Python functions to JS, `Import` to bring in npm packages, and `react_component` to wrap existing React components.

| Export | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `javascript` | Decorator for Python-to-JS transpilation |
| `JsFunction` | Transpiled JS function type |
| `Import` | Import a JS module or symbol |
| `react_component` | Wrap a React component for use in Pulse |
| `run_js` | Execute arbitrary JS on the client |

## Middleware

Middleware intercepts requests before they reach your components. Use it for authentication, logging, redirects, and other cross-cutting concerns.

| Export | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `stack` | Create middleware stack |
| `PulseMiddleware` | Base middleware class |
| `MiddlewareStack` | Middleware chain |
| `LatencyMiddleware` | Add artificial latency (dev) |
| `Redirect` | Middleware redirect response |
| `NotFound` | Middleware 404 response |
| `Ok` | Middleware success response |
| `Deny` | Middleware deny response |

## Cookies and Sessions

Manage client cookies and server-side session storage. Sessions persist user data across requests.

| Export | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Cookie` | Cookie configuration |
| `SetCookie` | Cookie with value to set |
| `SessionStore` | Abstract session storage |
| `CookieSessionStore` | JWT-based cookie sessions |

## Context

Access the current request context. Useful for advanced scenarios where you need direct access to the underlying request.

| Export | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `PulseContext` | Current request context |
| `PulseRequest` | Incoming request wrapper |

## Plugin System

Extend Pulse with custom functionality. Plugins can hook into the app lifecycle to add features like authentication providers or analytics.

| Export | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Plugin` | Base class for app plugins |

## Helpers

Miscellaneous utilities for common tasks.

| Export | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `CSSProperties` | TypedDict for inline styles |
| `repeat` | Repeat a value n times |
| `later` | Schedule a callback after delay |

## VDOM Types

Type annotations for Pulse's virtual DOM. Use these for type hints in components that return or manipulate elements.

| Export | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Element` | JSX/HTML element node |
| `Node` | Any renderable node |
| `PulseNode` | Server component instance |
| `Primitive` | `bool`, `int`, `float`, `str`, `None` |

## Event Handler Types

Type annotations for event handlers with varying argument counts. Useful for strict typing of callbacks.

| Export | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `EventHandler0` | Handler with 0 extra args |
| `EventHandler1` | Handler with 1 extra arg |
| `EventHandler2` | Handler with 2 extra args |
| ... | Up to `EventHandler10` |

## Environment

Access environment variables and detect the current runtime mode (development, CI, or production).

| Export | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `PulseEnv` | Literal type: `'dev'`, `'ci'`, `'prod'` |
| `env` | Environment variables accessor |
| `mode()` | Get current `PulseEnv` |
