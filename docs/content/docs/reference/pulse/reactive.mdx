title: "Reactive Core"
description: "Signals, computeds, effects, batching"

Exports:
`AsyncEffect`, `AsyncEffectFn`, `Batch`, `Computed`, `Effect`, `EffectFn`, `IgnoreBatch`, `Signal`, `Untrack`

Patterns:
- `Signal` and `Computed` are the reactive primitives
- `Effect` and `AsyncEffect` run side effects
- `Batch` groups updates
- `Untrack` disables dependency tracking
