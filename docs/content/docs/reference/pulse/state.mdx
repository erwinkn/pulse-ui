title: "State"
description: "State and reactive containers"

Exports:
- `State`
- `computed`, `effect` decorators
- `ReactiveList`, `ReactiveDict`, `ReactiveSet`
- `unwrap`

Rules:
- Public fields must be declared with type annotations
- Use `_private` for non-reactive values

Example:
```python
class Counter(ps.State):
    count: int = 0
    @ps.computed
    def doubled(self):
        return self.count * 2
```
