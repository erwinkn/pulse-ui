State is a class with typed fields. Use `ps.init()` to keep it across renders.

```python
class Counter(ps.State):
    count: int = 0

    def inc(self):
        self.count += 1

@ps.component
def counter():
    with ps.init():
        st = Counter()
    return ps.button(f"Count: {st.count}", onClick=st.inc)
```

Rules:
- Public fields must be annotated
- Use `_private` for non-reactive values
