Components are reusable functions with stable state.

```python
@ps.component
def Card(title: str, *children, key=None):
    return ps.div(ps.h3(title), *children, className="border p-3")

@ps.component
def page():
    return Card("Hello")[ps.p("Inside")]
```

Use `key` to preserve identity when order changes.
