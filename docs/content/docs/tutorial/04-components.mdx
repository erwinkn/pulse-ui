So far, we've been writing everything in a single component. As your application grows, you'll want to break it into smaller, reusable pieces. That's what Pulse components are for.

## What is a Component?

A Pulse component is a reusable piece of UI that can have its own state and lifecycle. Components are created by decorating a function with `@ps.component`:

```python
@ps.component
def Greeting(name: str):
    return ps.div(
        ps.h2(f"Hello, {name}!"),
        ps.p("Welcome to Pulse."),
    )
```

You can use this component anywhere in your app:

```python
@ps.component
def page():
    return ps.div(
        Greeting(name="Alice"),
        Greeting(name="Bob"),
    )
```

Each `Greeting` instance is independent - they don't share state.

## Component Props

Components can accept **props** (properties) as function arguments. Props are how parent components pass data to children:

```python
@ps.component
def Card(title: str, subtitle: str = ""):
    return ps.div(className="border rounded p-4 shadow")[
        ps.h3(title, className="text-lg font-bold"),
        ps.p(subtitle, className="text-gray-600") if subtitle else None,
    ]
```

Use it like:

```python
Card(title="Welcome")
Card(title="Settings", subtitle="Manage your preferences")
```

## Component Children

Components can accept children using `*children` as a variadic argument:

```python
@ps.component
def Card(title: str, *children, key=None):
    return ps.div(className="border rounded p-4 shadow")[
        ps.h3(title, className="text-lg font-bold"),
        *children,
    ]
```

With `*children`, you can use bracket syntax to pass child elements:

```python
Card(title="User Profile")[
    ps.p("Name: Alice"),
    ps.p("Email: alice@example.com"),
]
```

This reads naturally - the card "contains" its children, just like HTML.

## State in Components

Each component instance can have its own state. This is what makes components truly reusable:

```python
class ToggleState(ps.State):
    on: bool = False

    def toggle(self):
        self.on = not self.on

@ps.component
def Toggle(label: str):
    with ps.init():
        st = ToggleState()

    return ps.button(
        f"{label}: {'ON' if st.on else 'OFF'}",
        onClick=st.toggle,
        className="px-3 py-1 rounded border",
    )

@ps.component
def settings():
    return ps.div(className="space-y-2")[
        Toggle(label="Wi-Fi"),
        Toggle(label="Bluetooth"),
        Toggle(label="Airplane Mode"),
    ]
```

Each toggle maintains its own state independently. Clicking one doesn't affect the others.

## Component Keys

By default, Pulse identifies components by their position in the tree. This works fine for static layouts, but can cause problems when components move around (like in a list that can be reordered).

**Keys** tell Pulse which component is which, regardless of position:

```python
@ps.component
def ListItem(text: str, key=None):
    with ps.init():
        st = ToggleState()

    return ps.div(className="flex items-center gap-2")[
        ps.input(type="checkbox", checked=st.on, onChange=st.toggle),
        ps.span(text),
    ]

@ps.component
def todo_list():
    items = ["Learn Pulse", "Build an app", "Ship it"]

    return ps.div()[
        [ListItem(text=item, key=item) for item in items]
    ]
```

With keys:
- If you reorder items, each `ListItem` keeps its checkbox state
- If you add an item at the start, existing items shift but keep their state

Without keys:
- State is tied to position, not identity
- Reordering or inserting can cause state to "jump" between items

**Rule of thumb**: Always use keys when rendering components from a list.

## Complete Example: Reusable Card Component

Here's a complete example showing a reusable card component with props, children, and composition:

```python
import pulse as ps

@ps.component
def Card(title: str, *children, key=None, variant: str = "default"):
    border_color = "border-blue-500" if variant == "primary" else "border-gray-200"

    return ps.div(className=f"border-2 {border_color} rounded-lg p-4 shadow-sm")[
        ps.h3(title, className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2"),
        ps.div(className="text-gray-700")[
            *children,
        ],
    ]

@ps.component
def StatCard(label: str, value: int, key=None):
    with ps.init():
        # Each stat card could have its own state if needed
        pass

    return Card(title=label, variant="primary")[
        ps.p(f"{value}", className="text-3xl font-bold text-blue-600"),
    ]

@ps.component
def dashboard():
    return ps.div(className="p-6 space-y-4")[
        ps.h1("Dashboard", className="text-2xl font-bold"),

        ps.div(className="grid grid-cols-3 gap-4")[
            StatCard(label="Users", value=1234, key="users"),
            StatCard(label="Orders", value=567, key="orders"),
            StatCard(label="Revenue", value=89012, key="revenue"),
        ],

        Card(title="Recent Activity")[
            ps.ul(className="list-disc list-inside")[
                ps.li("User signed up"),
                ps.li("Order placed"),
                ps.li("Payment received"),
            ],
        ],
    ]

app = ps.App([ps.Route("/", dashboard)])
```

This demonstrates:
- **Reusable Card** with customizable title, children, and variant
- **Composed StatCard** that uses Card internally
- **Keys** for list-like grid items
- **Clean separation** of concerns
