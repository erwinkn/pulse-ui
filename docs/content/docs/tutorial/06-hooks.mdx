title: "Hooks"
---

Use hooks once per render.

- `ps.init()` keeps locals across renders
- `ps.setup(fn, *args)` runs once, returns cached result
- `ps.state(key, factory)` stores a keyed state instance
- `ps.effects(*fns)` registers effects
- `ps.stable(key, value)` keeps stable refs

Example: stable callback

```python
@ps.component
def editor(on_save):
    on_save = ps.stable("on_save", on_save)
    with ps.init():
        st = EditorState(on_save)
    ...
```
