Computed values and effects live on `State`.

```python
class TodoState(ps.State):
    text: str = ""

    @ps.computed
    def upper(self):
        return self.text.upper()

    @ps.effect
    def log(self):
        print(self.text)
```

Use `ps.Untrack()` to avoid dependency tracking in effects.
Use `ps.Batch()` to group updates.
