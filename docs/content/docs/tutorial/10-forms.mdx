Use `ps.Form` for server-registered forms or `ManualForm` for manual wiring.

```python
class Log(ps.State):
    last: dict | None = None
    async def submit(self, data: ps.FormData):
        self.last = data

@ps.component
def page():
    with ps.init():
        st = Log()

    return ps.Form(key="demo", onSubmit=st.submit)[
        ps.input(name="email", type="email"),
        ps.button("Submit", type="submit"),
    ]
```

`FormData` supports file uploads via `UploadFile`.
