Congratulations on completing the Pulse tutorial! You now understand the core concepts that power Pulse applications: components, state, hooks, events, queries, routing, sessions, and more. But there's always more to learn and explore.

Here's where to go from here, depending on what you want to do next.

## Deepen Your Understanding

**The Core Guide** provides comprehensive coverage of every Pulse concept. While this tutorial introduced you to the basics, the guide goes deeper with more examples, edge cases, and best practices.

- Learn advanced state patterns like global state and computed properties
- Understand the full lifecycle of components and effects
- Master async patterns for complex data flows

## Find Solutions to Specific Problems

**The Cookbook** is a collection of recipes for common tasks. If you're wondering "how do I build X with Pulse?", the cookbook probably has an answer.

Examples include:
- Building a complete authentication flow
- Creating a real-time dashboard
- Implementing infinite scroll
- Setting up file uploads with progress
- Building a multi-step form wizard

[Browse the Cookbook](/docs/cookbook)

## Look Up Specifics

**The Reference** is your go-to for API details. When you need to know exactly what arguments a function accepts or what a class does, the reference has the complete documentation.

Every function, class, decorator, and component in Pulse is documented here with type signatures and usage examples.

## Use Component Libraries

**Packages** extend Pulse with pre-built components for common needs. Instead of building everything from scratch, use these battle-tested integrations:

- **pulse-mantine**: A comprehensive UI component library with buttons, forms, modals, and more
- **pulse-ag-grid**: Professional data grids with sorting, filtering, and virtualization
- **pulse-recharts**: Beautiful charts and data visualizations
- **pulse-lucide**: Thousands of icons ready to use
- **pulse-msal**: Microsoft authentication integration
- **pulse-aws**: Tools for deploying Pulse apps to AWS

[See all Packages](/docs/packages)

## Build AI-Powered Applications

**AI Agents** documentation covers building applications that integrate with large language models. Pulse's real-time capabilities make it perfect for AI interfaces with streaming responses.

Learn how to:
- Build chat interfaces with streaming responses
- Create tool-using agents with Pulse UIs
- Integrate with OpenAI, Anthropic, and other providers

## Get Involved

Pulse is open source and welcomes contributions. Whether you want to report a bug, suggest a feature, improve documentation, or contribute code, we'd love to have you.

- Browse the source code on GitHub
- Open issues for bugs or feature requests
- Join discussions about the future of Pulse
- Submit pull requests to contribute

## Keep Building

The best way to learn is by doing. Here are some project ideas to practice your Pulse skills:

**Beginner projects:**
- A personal todo app with persistence
- A simple blog with markdown support
- A weather dashboard using a public API

**Intermediate projects:**
- A real-time chat application
- A kanban board with drag-and-drop
- An expense tracker with charts

**Advanced projects:**
- A collaborative document editor
- A project management tool
- A real-time multiplayer game

Whatever you build, we'd love to see it. Share your projects and ask questions in the community.

Happy building!
