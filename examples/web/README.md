# Pulse + React Router example

A minimal React Router application wired up to the Pulse UI client. It is intended as a reference for integrating Pulse into an SSR-ready React Router project without any extra tooling.

## What's included
- React Router SSR with the default `react-router-serve` server
- Tailwind CSS via `@tailwindcss/vite`
- Pulse UI client components served from the `/app` alias

## Setup

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Generate a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

Type definitions can be refreshed with:

```bash
npm run typecheck
```
