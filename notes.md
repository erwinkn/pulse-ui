My wife is undergoing an AMP protocol and just had an IUI. She has an extensive supplementation stack, based on recommendations from her functional doctor and her fertility clinic:
- Upon waking up: Euthyral, 20mcg L-T3, 100mcg L-T4.
- Morning: 
  - DHEA 10mg
  - Pregnenolone 30mg
  - Metformin 280mg (Stagid)
  - D3 5000IU + K2 200mcg
  - Iodine 125mcg
- Every meal: digestive enzymes + FUT-2 + butyrate
- Lunch or dinner: 
  - Vitamin C 1000mg
  - Zinc 10mg + copper 1000 mcg + manganese 2mg
  - Q10 200mg, twice
  - Methylated B-vitamin complex
- Afternoon: iron 14mg + lactoferrin 400mg
- Bedtime:
  - Magnesium 300mg
  - Myo-inositol 2g
  - NAC 600mg
  - L-Glycine 5g

For context:
- She also has MTHFR and non-secretor FUT2 mutations
- She has diagnosed FHA with no known cause or metabolic disorder. The irregular cycles appeared after coming off birth control 5 years ago and at their peak, she had no menstruations for over a year
- The FHA was accompanied with lower energy, weight gain (up to 15kg), hair loss, low libido, etc...
- She also has low AMH and produces 2-6 follicles per cycle. Low follicle cycles get converted into an IUI, higher follicle cycles into IVF
- The L-T3 + L-T4 was prescribed by her functional doctor after discovering normal-low levels of thyroid hormones combined with symptoms of hypothyroidism and a DIO2 mutation impairing conversion of T4 into T3
- The Metformin was prescribed to help with the weight gain 
- The other supplements are a mix of fertility boosters + deficiencies found through blood tests (iodine, pregnenolone, iron)
- Overall, since starting her functional medicine journey, her health has improved a lot and her periods have returned to a 1 to 2 months cycle, so still irregular but much better. She has regained most of her libido, lost weight, her hair is denser, etc...

Of those supplements:
- Which should she continue taking during the 2 weeks post IUI where her pregnancy status is not known? The goal is to keep optimizing for fertility for eventual future stimulation cycles
- Which should she discontinue if pregnancy is confirmed?
