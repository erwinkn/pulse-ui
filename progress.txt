Pulse docs migration progress

Context
- Replaced Mintlify docs with Fumadocs app in `docs/`
- Old Mintlify docs moved to `.context/docs-mintlify`
- Tutorial moved into docs and split into chapter MDX files
- IA skeleton + nav meta created; most pages are TODO placeholders

Completed
- Scaffolded Fumadocs site with bun
- Branding updates:
  - `docs/lib/layout.shared.tsx` title = Pulse, githubUrl set
  - `docs/app/(home)/page.tsx` hero copy + buttons
  - `docs/app/docs/[[...slug]]/page.tsx` github repo link points to erwinkn/pulse-ui
- New docs content tree under `docs/content/docs`:
  - Root `index.mdx` updated
  - `meta.json` with top-level sections: getting-started, tutorial, guide, cookbook, reference, packages, ai
  - Section meta + placeholder MDX files created for each section
- Getting started content filled (install/first-app/dev-loop/index)
- Tutorial split from `tutorial/README.md` into `docs/content/docs/tutorial/*.mdx`

Key files added/modified
- `docs/` (new Next.js Fumadocs app)
- `docs/content/docs/**` (new content)
- `docs/README.md` (bun dev command)
- `progress.txt` (this file)

Pending work (high priority)
1) Tutorial rewrite to current API:
   - Replace `ps.states` with `ps.init`/`ps.setup`/`ps.state`
   - Fix cross-links and headings post-split
   - Update references to run commands (use `uv run pulse dev ...`)
2) Manual API reference:
   - From `packages/pulse/python/src/pulse/__init__.py`
   - Advanced modules: `pulse.js`, `pulse.transpiler`
   - Package exports for pulse-mantine, ag-grid, recharts, lucide, msal, aws
   - JS client exports from `packages/pulse/js/src/index.ts`
3) Core guide pages + cookbook + packages + AI agent docs
4) Adjust Fumadocs nav/details if needed

Commands
- Run docs dev server:
  - `cd docs && bun run dev`

Notes
- Non-ASCII cleaned in docs root + home page; tutorial still contains ASCII only
- `docs/` has its own `package.json` and `bun.lock`
- `docs` currently not added to root workspace
